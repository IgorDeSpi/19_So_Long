# So_Long


## Mandatory part

The aim of the project was to make a 2D game with a player that needed to collect all the coins before leaving the level.

## Bonus part
The aim of the bonus part was to code an enemy that can kill you if you encounter it, we also had to animate something (I chose the coins and the enemy) and at least we had to add a mouvement counter.
